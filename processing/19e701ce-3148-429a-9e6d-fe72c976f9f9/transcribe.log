[00:00.000 --> 00:04.080]  because you were sick for men. That's how men view it. No shirt's on,
[00:04.080 --> 00:08.080]  L-print. Girl, it's going to do it too. Okay.
[00:08.080 --> 00:13.000]  Limit their shirt with their bodies. So the analogy I gave you is how men feel when a
[00:13.000 --> 00:16.440]  girl wants to still be outside and do these things. Like you're saying, well, you
[00:16.440 --> 00:19.480]  would, I attracted you and you met me when I was like this. Well, yeah, it's time to take
[00:19.480 --> 00:24.600]  the first self sign off your neck. So like posting a regular selfie that that he
[00:24.600 --> 00:28.200]  knows that other guys are going to find attractive is the problem still. I mean,
[00:28.200 --> 00:32.320]  yeah, it's fairly disrespectful to the men. So post your face. I mean, let's
[00:32.320 --> 00:36.280]  be honest here, most girls don't just post their face. They post their bodies.
[00:36.280 --> 00:39.240]  They throw maybe third shop and whatever may be. And what I'm just saying is
[00:39.240 --> 00:45.640]  understandable, but I mean, like just regular picture. I mean, why post it though,
[00:45.640 --> 00:50.680]  why why post it if you have a man? Why post yourself on your social media?
[00:50.680 --> 00:53.360]  Yeah, just keep it on your phone. Why you got to post it for the internet to see.
[00:53.400 --> 00:59.440]  All right. That's very toxic. Okay. It's very, like, oh, I'm in a relationship with
[00:59.440 --> 00:59.960]  you. You can't.
